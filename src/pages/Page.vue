    <br>
    <p>Iâ€™m from the Philippines.</p>
    <p>I have been coding professionally for a year now.</p>
    <p>I am a developer in a startup company and I am using Python/Django for most of the projects
    that I am doing.</p>
    <p>Being exposed in the startup culture, I became fascinated with the whole tech community.</p>
    <p>I attended hackathons, meetups, and summits since then.</p>
    <p>Being a developer in a startup is both exciting and challenging. We got to try a lot of
    modern and trending technologies what we referred to as our <em>new toys</em>. But in exchange
    we have a lot of things to study. We have to be full-stack.</p>
